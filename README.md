# Car-Rental-System
## Overview
The Car Rental System is a project developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It provides a user-friendly interface for renting cars based on various criteria such as car type, capacity, price range, and transmission type. The system filters available cars, displays the options to the user, and calculates the total rental price based on the hourly rate of the chosen car.
